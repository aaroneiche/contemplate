#Contemplate

Contemplate is a web app of simple self-reflection. It asks you questions, you answer them.
It doesn't send the questions anywhere, or do anything greater with them, just gives you the opportunity to think about yourself, how you're doing, and where you want to go.

Contemplate gets its inspiration from an app I had on my Mac when I was a kid called "Synchronicity". I learned very recently that Synchronicity was a computerized I,Ching
software. It would encourage you to think through something that was troubling you, and included a pleasant 1-bit Japanese garden to contemplate by.

I, Ching isn't quite the way I wanted to go - so this is a bit more abstract, but I do think it'll help reflect and grow.

###Running
Contemplate is a simple web app - it runs independently of anything else. So you can just open up the index.html in a browser and you're off! Keep in mind, it is incomplete so if you're not a web developer you may have trouble recovering your answers.
